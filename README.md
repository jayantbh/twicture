#Twicture

A tiny chrome extension that adds a *Twicture* button to tweets, allowing you to save and share tweets as PNG images.

Based on, and referenced from Bhaskar Tiwari's extension, [Download Quora Answers](https://github.com/bhskt/download-quora-answers).

ToDo:

- Fix image not rendering issue.
- Fix *Twicture* button not showing on new tweets issue.
- Fix *Twicture* button not showing on tweets page.
- Add a nice blue border to the image.
